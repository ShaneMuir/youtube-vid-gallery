== Description ==
Youtube Vid Gallery is a powerful and easy-to-use WordPress plugin that allows you to create and manage a gallery of YouTube videos on your website. The plugin uses a custom post type to manage videos and provides a shortcode to display the video gallery anywhere on your site.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/youtube-vid-gallery` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Add videos to your gallery using the custom post type "YouTube Videos" in the WordPress dashboard.
4. Use the provided shortcode to display the video gallery on any page or post.

== Usage ==
1. **Custom Post Type**: After activating the plugin, a new custom post type "YouTube Videos" will be added to your WordPress dashboard. Use this to add, edit, and manage your YouTube videos.

2. **Shortcode**: Use `[youtube_vid_gallery]` to display the YouTube video gallery on any page or post.

   Example:
            [youtube_vid_gallery]

This shortcode will display a grid of your YouTube videos. The display settings can be customized via the plugin's settings page in the WordPress dashboard.
